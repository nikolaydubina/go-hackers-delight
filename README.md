> If you write optimizing compilers or high-performance code, you must read this book.  
> — [Guy L. Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele_Jr.) [PhD, ACM Award, AAAI Fellow, Sun Fellow, core Java design]

> This is the first book that promises to tell the deep, dark secrets of computer arithmetic, and it delivers in spades. It contains every trick I knew plus many, many more.
> A godsend for library developers, compiler writers, and lovers of elegant hacks.
> It deserves a spot on your self right next to Knuth.
> In the ten years since the first edition came out, it's been absolutely invaluable to my work at Sun and Google.
